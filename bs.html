<p align="center"><font color="">Brawl Stars is a real-time combat game where two teams of three characters each have to battle it out in a setting full of obstacles and elements to interact with. Your objective: teach the other team a lesson.<br>Controlling your character is easy, and in fact, you can do so using only one finger, with your device in the vertical position. You just have to touch and slide your finger around the screen to move your character and attack. You can also unleash your special abilities this way, which are essential if you want to have a good chance at victory.<br>In Brawl Stars, you can find various game modes. In the 'rewards' mode your objective is to finish the game with more stars than the other team. In other game modes, you have to fight for a series of crystals found in the middle of the map, or compete directly against other players in an epic 'deathmatch.'<br>Brawl stars is another hit from Supercell; it's perfectly designed for mobile devices, has nice controls, a huge variety of characters and game modes, and absolutely charming graphics.</font></p>
