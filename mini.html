<p align="center"><font color="">Doodle Army 2: Mini Militia is a 2D multiplayer action game that challenges you to face opponents from all over the world.<br> There's even the option to join in with up to six different players logged on simultaneously during online battles via mobile.

Gameplay is super user-friendly: the virtual joystick that helps you move your character is located on the left side of the screen and the aiming stick is to the right. Your weapon shoots automatically as long as you're pointing at your target. So, all you have to do is worry about aiming.

Each scene is fairly open-ended, there's lots of space for you to explore. In fact, you’ll have plenty of space to move around and escape from your enemies whenever needed. There are also tons of weapons and grenades on each level.

<br>Doodle Army 2: Mini Militia is a multiplayer action game that offers you fun battles, although the visuals are pretty basic. </font></p>
