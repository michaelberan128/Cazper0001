<p align="center"><font color="">Free Fire - Battlegrounds is a third-person action game that's openly inspired by PUBG. Join a group of up to 50 players as they battle to the death on an enormous island full of weapons and vehicles. Only one player can make it off this island alive.<br>
The controls in Free Fire - Battlegrounds are simple: on the left side of the screen there's a virtual d-pad to control your character, while on the right side, you'll find buttons to shoot, crouch, lay down, and jump. Whenever you find a weapon, crate, vehicle, or a door, interact with it by tapping on the button that appears on-screen. In the upper right corner, you'll also find your inventory where you can select the weapon you want to use.<br>
The way the game develops in Free Fire - Battlegrounds is very similar to the aforementioned PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds or any other battle royale-type game. The game starts out with all the players landing on the island via parachute. As soon as they land, they have to set off running to find weapons and survive the attacks from the rest of the players. Watch out for the force field that gradually closes in on you as the game goes on. If it reaches you--you're dead. Luckily, if you get stuck too close to the forcefield, you can opt to speed away in any of the vehicles you find.<br>
The main difference between Free Fire - Battlegrounds and other similar games is that, instead of hosting games of 100 players, there are only 50. And the length of each match is adjusted accordingly. Instead of playing for 30 minutes, most rounds only last around 15 minutes. Basically, it's a faster and more hectic PUBG.<br>
Free Fire - Battlegrounds is a battle royale that offers an incredibly fun and addicting game experience. The game also takes up less memory space than other similar games and is much less demanding on your Android, so practically anyone can enjoy playing it.
