<h1><center><font color="red"><u>About Corrom Pool</u></font></center></h1>

<p align="center"align="center"><font color="">Carrom Pool is a super fun game that's similar to the all-time classic pool and challenges you to introduce the same colored tiles in each of the holes on the board. The player who can get rid of all their tiles first wins the game.<br>
Gameplay in Carrom Pool is pretty simple and that's part of what makes this game so addicting. The only thing you have to pay attention to is whether your tiles are the black ones or the white ones. After that, your mission is to hit them to try to introduce each one of them on the correct hole. You can also check out your score at all times on the upper part of the screen, just under your picture.<br>
Controls are really user-friendly because you first have to tap on the throw tile to locate it. Then, slide your finger to trace the trajectory and let go whenever you want to release the tile.<br>
The player that gets rid of all their tiles first wins. It should also be noted that you could also win all the coins in each round. We're basically talking about a game that'll keep you entertained for a good while by beating all your rivals.
